# CoffeeApp

CoffeeApp is an Angular based application to view a list of various coffees gathered from an API endpoint. Users are introduced to a plethora of coffees and can view their descriptions by clicking each of them. 

This application is created to showcase the features of Angular NgRx. NgRx Store, Actions, Reducers, Effects, Selectors and more are used. Bootstrap is used to create the visual appeal.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
